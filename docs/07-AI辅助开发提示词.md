# 使用AI辅助编程（如Cursor）的提示词

## 数据库 (Schema & D1)

*   **创建Schema:** "Analyze the following business requirements [paste requirements here] and the attached Excel file screenshot [attach image]. Generate a normalized SQL schema for a Cloudflare D1 database. The schema should include tables for products and jejich daily metrics (production, sales, inventory, price). Add comments explaining the purpose of each table and column. Also, create appropriate indexes on foreign keys and date columns to optimize query performance."
*   **修改Schema:** "I need to add a 'notes' column to the `DailyMetrics` table in my `schema.sql` file. It should be a `TEXT` column and can be null. Please generate the `ALTER TABLE` statement."

## 数据导入 (Python & Worker)

*   **Python脚本:** "Write a Python script using pandas to read an Excel file named `data.xlsx`. The script should:
    1.  Read the 'Sheet1'.
    2.  Clean the data: ensure the 'date' column is in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
    3.  Extract unique product names into a `Products` DataFrame.
    4.  Create a `DailyMetrics` DataFrame and replace product names with a foreign key ID from the `Products` data.
    5.  Connect to a temporary local SQLite database, and use `to_sql` to populate the `Products` and `DailyMetrics` tables.
    6.  Finally, dump the entire SQLite database into a single `import_data.sql` file that includes `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements."
*   **Worker上传端点:** "Create a new POST route `/api/upload` in my Hono application (`backend/src/index.ts`). This endpoint should handle a multipart/form-data request containing an Excel file. Use the SheetJS/xlsx library to parse the file buffer. Then, iterate through the rows, and for each row, prepare a D1 `INSERT` statement. Finally, use the `D1.batch()` method to insert all the data into the `DailyMetrics` table in a single transaction. Add robust error handling for file parsing and database operations."

## 后端API (Hono & Worker)

*   **创建新端点:** "In my Hono app, create a new GET endpoint at `/api/trends/sales-price`. It should accept `start_date` and `end_date` query parameters. Write a D1 query that calculates the total sales volume and average price for each day within that date range. The query should `GROUP BY` record_date. Return the results as a JSON array."
*   **重构/优化查询:** "Review the following D1 query in my Worker code. Can it be optimized? I need to join `DailyMetrics` and `Products` to get the top 10 products by inventory on a specific date. Ensure the query uses indexes effectively."
*   **添加验证:** "Add input validation to this Hono route handler. The `limit` query parameter should be a positive integer, and `date` should be a valid 'YYYY-MM-DD' string. If validation fails, return a 400 Bad Request response with a clear error message."

## 前端 (JavaScript & ECharts)

*   **创建图表:** "Generate the JavaScript code to initialize an ECharts instance in the div with id `sales-price-chart`. Create an ECharts option object for a dual-Y-axis chart. The left Y-axis should represent 'Sales Volume (tons)' and the right Y-axis should represent 'Average Price (RMB/ton)'. The X-axis will be populated with dates. Configure the legend and tooltips appropriately."
*   **连接API:** "Write an `async` JavaScript function called `updateChart`. This function should:
    1.  Accept `startDate` and `endDate` as arguments.
    2.  Display the ECharts loading animation using `chart.showLoading()`.
    3.  Use `fetch` to call the `/api/trends/sales-price` endpoint with the provided dates.
    4.  Process the JSON response, separating dates, sales data, and price data into three arrays.
    5.  Update the ECharts instance with the new data using `chart.setOption()`.
    6.  Hide the loading animation in a `finally` block.
    7.  Include a `catch` block to log errors to the console."
*   **添加交互:** "Add an event listener to the button with id `filter-btn`. When clicked, it should read the values from the `start-date` and `end-date` input fields and then call the `updateChart` function with these values."

## 测试 (Vitest)

*   **编写测试用例:** "Write a Vitest integration test for my Hono worker. Use `unstable_dev` to start a local server. The test should send a `fetch` request to the `/api/inventory/top?date=2024-06-20` endpoint. Before the test, you'll need to mock the D1 database and seed it with some sample product and metric data. Assert that the response status is 200 and that the returned JSON is an array of objects, each containing `product_name` and `inventory_level`."
